# Minimax Algorithm Workshop/Paper

This was is a project done with 2 friends for an assignment. The Assignment was to create a workshop for a topic and write a paper (min 6 Pages) about that topic.
The repo was build so the others can follow along and has 2 other branches with the finished versions of the minimax and alpha-beta algorithms. The `minimax` branch includes only minimax while the `alphaBeta` branch includes both.
